The aptly named Frankenstein is a design tool which
- ties together various Approach layers; especially: Imprints, Resources, Components and Compositions
- enforces best practices and constraints from HTML/CSS structure to token handling
- enables realtime low-code. prototyping is implementing.
- helps you auto-commit to your fork's branch of the code and stage it


If it works in Frankenstein, it will work for any Approach project

Frankenstein is still in heavy development. 
Its core exists. The interface worked once, long ago, before the great overhaul.

1. Revive Frankenstein with new, fancier Approach::Service layer and improved interface library
  - Replace the old mapper iframe with the upgraded mappers 
  - Replace the old interface acc.js with event delegation patterns used in approach.inflate.js
  - Link logged in user to their repo fork & branch instead of using the config database
  - Let user select project repo to work on
  
2. Get a real design for the interface assets
  - Dear contributor, how are you doing today? Nice weather we're having. Heeey, so, ever used any art software?
3. Add props and stages
  - ez
4. Add climbs
  - Community feedback
  - If/When the matcher tool exists, integrate that
  - If/When the profile tool exists, integrate that
  - If/When the team tool exists, integrate that
  - If/When the orchestra tool exists, integrate that
5. Lightning
